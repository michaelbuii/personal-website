## Overview

**Currently a work in progress**

The website is meant to be a site for selling & educating on the benefits of Matcha green tea.

I'm currently building this website to gain experience working with Drupal.
The site is using Bootstrap on Drupal 9 - similar to the environment at my current workplace.

I'm currently working on custom twig templates for different pages and creating custom block elements to familiarize myself with how Drupal works.

## How I built it

The website is deployed to Pantheonsite.io and is version controlled through git. I use a local environment to test my changes & push the code to the Pantheon git repository.

## Reflection

Drupal is still new to me so I hope to familiarize myself along the way while trying to make this website.
