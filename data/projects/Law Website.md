## Overview

I built this website to learn & improve my skills working with flexbox and animations. The website is also to refresh my skills on responsive design working with css.

The site is a mock website for a law firm named Bui & Associates. 

Source Code: [GitHub](https://github.com/michaelbuii/law-website)

## How I built it

The website is built using plain html, CSS, and Javascript.

## Reflection

I wanted to sharpen my skills in CSS & html by building this website.
The website showcases various animation techniques I've recently learned.
It also shows understanding of responsive design & media queries.

For my next project I hope to use exclusively css grid.
