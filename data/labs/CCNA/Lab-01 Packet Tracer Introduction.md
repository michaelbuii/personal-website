## Overview

In this lab we're just going to get familiar with using the packet tracer software
This is the first lab I'll be doing while following Jeremy's IT Lab CCNA playlist on youtube
Documentation: [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHqJ74J2sDU&list=PLxbwE86jKRgMpuZuLBivzlM8s2Dk5lXBQ)

We'll be recreating this network topology in packet tracer:

## Instructions

1. The bottom left provides icons to select different devices ![](https://bui.blob.core.windows.net/labs/Lab_2022_07_12_23_11.webp)

2. Use the thunderbolt icon to automatically choose connection types ![](https://bui.blob.core.windows.net/labs/Lab_2022_07_12_28_55.webp)
3. Connect all the devices like the diagram

## Conclusion

This was a simple lab, but it was to get familiar with the interface with Packet Tracer.
The ending diagram in Packet Tracer should look like this:
