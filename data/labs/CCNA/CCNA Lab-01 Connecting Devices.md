## Overview

In this lab we're gonna choose the correct cable based on the scenario. We're going to assume that Auto MDI-X is disabled.
Auto MDI-X allows devices to detect which device is sending and which is receiving data and automatically adjust.

## Instructions

1. Choose the correct connection types from the bottom right
2. Take note that distances of 3km need single-mode fiber
3. Distances of 250m can use single-mode fiber, but its best to use multi-mode fiber
